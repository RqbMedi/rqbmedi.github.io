I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Applied Mathematics Department of [Polytechnique Montreal](https://www.polymtl.ca/) (Poly) and [Gerad](https://www.gerad.ca/en), advised by Professors [El Hallaoui Issmaïl](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/el-hallaoui-issmail) & [Soumis François](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/soumis-francois). I specialize in large-scale optimization from several perspectives: *solver* (commercial and open-source), *metaheuristics* (local search, simulated annealing, etc.), *exact* (decompositions, branch-and-price, etc.), and *learning* (supervised, unsupervised, etc.). My Research is generously supported by the Fonds de recherche du Québec - Nature et Technologie ([FRQNT](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/)) and the [IVADO](https://ivado.ca/en/) Institute.

Prior to Poly, I obtained an MBA from [International University of Japan](https://www.iuj.ac.jp/) (IUJ), where I worked with Professor [Li Wenkai](http://rmap.iuj.ac.jp/profile/en.1d04074599d978f5.html) on designing an electric vehicle migration framework. I was fortunate to obtain a specialization in finance, leveraging my engineering and business backgrounds.

I also hold a master's degree in industrial engineering from [Ecole Mohammadia d'Ingénieurs](https://www.emi.ac.ma/) (EMI). 

My Curriculum Vitae can be found [here](http://rqbmedi.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
