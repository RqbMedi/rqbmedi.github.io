Hi, I am Mehdi. I have been learning, evolving, and growing up in Three Countries on Three Continents. In my beloved country Morocco, I confirmed the Value of Believing. In Japan, I understood the Value of Hardwork. In Canada, I witnessed the Value of Excellence. I am very grateful to these dear countries :-) !

<img alt="Canada" src="http://purecatamphetamine.github.io/country-flag-icons/3x2/CA.svg" width="22" height="22"/> **The Land of The Maple Leaf.** I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Applied Mathematics Department of Polytechnique Montreal ([Poly](https://www.polymtl.ca/)) and the Groupe d'Études et de Recherche en Analyse des Décisions ([Gerad](https://www.gerad.ca/en)), advised by Professors [El Hallaoui Issmaïl](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/el-hallaoui-issmail) & [Soumis François](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/soumis-francois). I specialize in large-scale optimization from several perspectives: *solver* (commercial, open-source, etc.), *metaheuristics* (local search, simulated annealing, etc.), *exact* (decompositions, branch-and-price, etc.), and *learning* (supervised, unsupervised, etc.). My Research is generously supported by the Fonds de recherche du Québec - Nature et Technologie ([FRQNT](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/)), the Institut de Valorisation des Données ([IVADO](https://ivado.ca/en/)), and the [OCP Group](https://www.ocpgroup.ma/). 

<img alt="Japan" src="http://purecatamphetamine.github.io/country-flag-icons/3x2/JP.svg" width="22" height="22"/> **The Land of The Rising Sun.** Prior to Poly, I obtained an MBA from the International University of Japan ([IUJ](https://www.iuj.ac.jp/)), where I worked with Professor [Li Wenkai](http://rmap.iuj.ac.jp/profile/en.1d04074599d978f5.html) on designing an electric vehicle migration framework. I was fortunate to obtain a specialization in finance, leveraging my engineering and business backgrounds. My MBA was generously supported by the Japan International Cooperation Agency ([JICA](https://www.jica.go.jp/english/)).

<img alt="Morocco" src="http://purecatamphetamine.github.io/country-flag-icons/3x2/MA.svg" width="22" height="22"/> **The Kingdom of The Western Place.** I also hold a master's degree in industrial engineering from Ecole Mohammadia d'Ingénieurs ([EMI](https://www.emi.ac.ma/)).
